'''Path Utilities (bpy.path)
   This module has a similar scope to os.path, containing utility
   functions for dealing with paths in Blender.

      @start (string or bytes): Relative to this path,when not set the current filename is used.
      
      @library (bpy.types.Library): The library this path is from. This is only included forconvenience, when the library is not None its path replaces *start*.
