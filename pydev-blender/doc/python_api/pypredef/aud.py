         @returns (Factory): The created Factory object.

It's recommended to use this only with factories	 with fast and accurate seeking, which is not true for encoded audio files, such ones should be buffered using :meth:buffer before being played reversed... warning:: If seeking is not accurate in the underlying factory you'll likely hear skips/jumps/cracks.
